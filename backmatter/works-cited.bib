  abstract = {Multi-pitch perception is investigated in a listening test using 30 recordings of musical sounds with two tones played simultaneously, except for two gong sounds with inharmonic overtone spectrum, judging roughness and separateness as the ability to tell the two tones in each recording apart. 13 sounds were from a Western guitar playing all 13 intervals in one octave, the other sounds were mainly from non-Western instruments comparing familiar with unfamiliar instrument sounds for Western listeners. Additionally the sounds were processed in a cochlear model transferring the mechanical basilar membrane motion into neural spikes followed by a post-processing simulating different degrees of coincidence detection. Separateness perception showed a clear distinction between familiar and unfamiliar sounds, while roughness perception did not. By correlating perception with simulation different perception strategies were found. Familiar sounds correlated strongly positive with high degrees of coincidence detection, where only 3-5 periodicities were left, while unfamiliar sounds correlated with low coincidence levels. This corresponds to an attention to pitch and timbre respectively. Additionally, separateness perception shows an opposite correlation between perception and neural correlates between familiar and unfamiliar sounds. This correlates with the perceptional finding of the distinction between familiar and unfamiliar sounds with separateness.},

The research documents the process from inception to creative output. Through an emergent, practice-led initial research phase, I fashion a developmental framework for assimilating new techniques and preparations into my musical vocabulary. The developmental framework has the potential to be linear, reflexive or flexible depending on context, and as such the tangible outcomes can be either finished creative works, development of new techniques, or knowledge about organisational aspects of placing the techniques in musical settings. Analysis of creative works is an integral part of the developmental framework and forms the bulk of this dissertation. The analytical essays within contain new knowledge about extended techniques, their potential and limitations, and realities inherent in their use in both compositional and improvisational contexts. Video, audio, notation and photos are embedded throughout the dissertation and form an integral part of the research project. Engagement with the media at appropriate junctures in the analysis is intended to enhance the narrative of the dissertation and facilitate a greater comprehension of the knowledge contained therein.},

  abstract = {Written notation has a long history in many musical traditions and has been particularly important in the composition and performance of Western art music. This study adopted the conceptual view that a musical score consists of two coordinated but separate communication channels: the musical text and a collection of composer-selected performance marks that serve as an interpretive gloss on that text. Structurally, these channels are defined by largely disjoint vocabularies of symbols and words. While the sound structures represented by musical texts are well studied in music theory and analysis, the stylistic patterns of performance marks and how they acquire contextual meaning in performance is an area with fewer theoretical foundations. This quantitative research explored the possibility that composers exhibit recurring patterns in their use of performance marks. Seventeen solo piano sonatas written between 1798 and 1913 by five major composers were analyzed from modern editions by tokenizing and tabulating the types and usage frequencies of their individual performance marks without regard to the associated musical texts. Using analytic methods common in information science, the results demonstrated persistent statistical similarities among the works of each composer and differences among the work groups of different composers. Although based on a small sample, the results still offered statistical support for the existence of recurring stylistic patterns in composers' use of performance marks across their works.},

While sound, whether constituted in phenomenological or idealist terms, is evolving and dynamic, notation is characterised by its ossifying imperative (Kim-Cohen 2009; Voegelin 2010). For Voegelin, a music score is regarded as conceptual, not perceptual. It is read as text and, it seems, has no meaningful place within a phenomenological practice of sound art (Voegelin 2010). The criticism that Vogelin’s phenomenalism, in particular, levels at notation invites close examination of notational practice and the semiotic structures that underwrite it. In this article, I seek to challenge the conceptual imperative of fixed notation through the presentation of a case study in the form of an original composition for string quartet and tape. Drawing on research by Rudolf Arnheim and Mark Johnson, a form of notation will be proposed that enables the score to escape singularly semiotic structures so that it may address the dynamic, phenomenological mode of experience that recent theories of sound art imply is beyond the reach of musical notation.},

  abstract = {The impetus for this study was the question of whether extended techniques are actually being taught in college trumpet studio settings as standard skills necessary on the instrument. The specific purposes of this document included: (1) catalogue the extended techniques available to today's trumpet performer, (2) reflect on their current use and address the question of how and when students are introduced to extended techniques, (3) contribute pedagogical exercises and suggestions to aid trumpeters in the study of some of the more challenging techniques, and (4) conclude with a "Guided Approach" to the literature detailing suggestions for the study of the twenty pieces referenced in this document. A survey was conducted of the current pedagogical status of extended techniques at the collegiate level. The online survey, which included questions regarding how and when students are introduced to extended techniques in their study of the trumpet, was completed by 166 college and university trumpet studio teachers from the United States and Canada. Examination of the results offers a unique view of the attention currently being given to extended techniques in college trumpet studios; they provide insight into specific teaching materials and performance repertoire being used by studio teachers today. Within each chapter pedagogical exercises assist in the study of certain techniques. The exercises are written as an introduction to many of these techniques, offering opportunities to experiment with the more challenging techniques before encountering them in the literature. Two specific techniques, multiphonics and flutter tonguing, are covered in greater detail with a larger collection of exercises. Pedagogical suggestions offered by the survey respondents are also included. Finally, the "Guided Approach" to the literature was compiled. Twenty pieces were selected and arranged in an order that provides a progressive approach to extended techniques. Each piece is catalogued through an individual profile which provides practical information regarding the piece: date, publication information, length, range, style of notation used, equipment requirements, who the piece was commissioned by or written for, a listing of all extended techniques employed, a listing of existing recordings, and a commentary concerning its particular challenges and benefits of study. The goal is to provide a resource for those who might not be familiar with the repertoire and help them choose appropriate literature for their students' level of experience with these techniques. There exists a need for additional pedagogical materials that can be used to introduce extended techniques to students of the trumpet. The document is designed to aid the serious student of the trumpet in meeting all the expectations of the repertoire.

In recent years, however, there has been an increasing amount of interest in the topic, and several publications have been devoted to acoustic guitar multiphonics. Primarily written for non-guitarist composers, these studies range from the scientific to the practical. Variously, they describe the sonic qualities of the multiphonics, discuss methods of performing them, or examine their spectral content and morphology. Until now, published research into guitar multiphonics has been limited to the acoustic guitar and has examined only its three lower strings. In this study, we analyse multiphonics on all six strings of the electric guitar and present a catalogue of harmonic aggregates on strings 3–1. We test these multiphonics on five different guitars and examine their response to three commonly used analogue effect pedals (compression, overdrive and distortion). In order to precisely indicate the spectral components and harmonic nodes, we have used the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation (HEJI).},

This article takes a practical look at multiphonics on the harp from a performer's point of view. I share my initial observations about their production, sound and predictability as well as their relationship to other harmonics on the harp. It is my hope that the article will lead to further investigation of this fascinating topic.},

  abstract = {This essay suggests that there is a definitive difference between »experimental music« and other forms of contemporary composition, and explicates this with reference to the sign theory of Charles Saunders Peirce. It suggests that experimental music is distinguished by a change in the dominant mode of signification from the symbolic to the indexicai: experimental music indicates, or draws attention to, the phenomena and relationships associated with the social practice known as music (for example, psychoacoustical phenomena, or the social relationships between audience, musicians and composers) and thereby offers information on how we make sense of music generally. The tendency of experimental music to present rather than represent such aspects is reflected in characteristic features of experimental music. Compositions by Alvin Luder, James Tenney, Klaus Lang and Akio Suzuki and others are referred to as examples of experimental music's practice of drawing attention to things, to phenomena and to relationships, and also to show how many other features of experimental music - including its tendency to simplicity of structure and the increased interest in writing music for specific environments - can also be related back to the general, indexicai tendency of presentation as opposed to representation.},

  abstract = {Of the many waveforms the bowed string can assume, the so-called “Helmholtz motion” (Helmholtz 1862) gives the fullest sound in terms of power and overtone richness. The development of this steady-state oscillation pattern can take many different paths, most of which would include noise caused by stick-slip irregularities of the bow-string contact. Of the five papers included in the thesis, the first one shows, not surprisingly, that tone onsets are considered superior when the attack noise has a very limited duration. It was found, however, that in this judgment the character of the noise plays an important part, as the listener’s tolerance of noise in terms of duration is almost twice as great for “slipping noise” as for “creaks” or “raucousness” during the tone onsets. The three following papers contain analyses focusing on how irregular slip-stick triggering may be avoided, as is quite often the case in practical playing by professionals. The fifth paper describes the triggering mechanism of a peculiar tone production referred to as “Anomalous Low Frequencies” (ALF). If properly skilled, a player can achieve pitches below the normal range of the instrument. This phenomenon is related to triggering waves taking “an extra turn” on the string before causing the string’s release from the bow-hair grip. Since transverse and torsional propagation speeds are both involved, two different sets of “sub-ranged” notes can be produced this way. In the four last papers wave patterns are analysed and explained through the use of computer simulations.},

  abstract = {By carefully positioning the bow and a lightly touching finger on the string, the string spectrum can be conditioned to provide narrow bands of pronounced energy. This leaves the impression of multiple complex tones with the normal (Helmholtz) fundamental as the lowest pitch. The phenomenon is seen to be caused by two additional signal loops, one on each side of the finger, which through the repeating slip pattern get phase locked to the full loop of the fundamental. Within the nominal period, however, the slip pulses will not be uniform like they are during the production of a normal “harmonic” or “flageolet” but may vary considerably in shape, size, and timing. For each string, there is a large number of bow/finger combinations that bear the potential of producing such tones. There are also two classes, depending on whether the bow or the finger is situated closest to the bridge. Touching the string with the finger closest to the bridge will somewhat emphasize the (Helmholtz) fundamental. The technique is applicable to double bass and cello, while less practical on shorter-stringed instruments. Analyses based on impulse responses and the Poisson summation formula provide an explanation to the underlying system properties.},

In parallel to this, classical performers typically programme older repertoire of composers that are no longer alive. The aims of this research are to bring the two artists - composer and performer - together in a collaboration project, and document the various procedures and outcomes used within the collaborative process. The differences between the collaborations will be compared and contrasted. Ultimately, it will be demonstrated that collaboration is a highly beneficial process with many mutual benefits for the composer and performer, and a case will be made to encourage future engagements of a similar nature. For this research, I have worked on three new solo piano works by three emerging composers, all of whom I have been in frequent contact with during the writing of this exegesis.},

Narrowing the pharynx, velar constriction, variation of the small mouth opening, and a tension of the walls of the mouth cavity are used. Changing prominent harmonics has the effect of creating an overtone melody with sustained tones, tone steps, and trillos.},

  abstract = {Hermann von Helmholtz and Carl Stumpf on Consonance and Dissonance. The article juxtaposes Hermann von Helmholtz's work in the experimental physiology of hearing and Carl Stumpf's tone psychology, focusing on the problem of consonance and dissonance in music. It argues that the experimental set-up plays a major role in the approaches to hearing of both Helmholtz and Stumpf, shaping their redefinition of the musical concepts of consonance and dissonance. Helmholtz, however, explains dissonance as resulting from the beats that are heard when sound waves interfere, while Stumpf explains consonance from the fusion (Verschmelzung) of sounds, noting that two tones, depending on their distance cannot always be recognized as two but are heard as one single tone. Helmholtz's definition of dissonance eventually threatens his own theory of hearing, which is based on the mechanical principle of resonance and considers sound to be composed of sinusoidal waves. Both the physical and the mathematical tools he uses cannot easily be brought into accordance with his experimental findings on beats, which ask for a discrimination of fast changes in intensity. Dissonance thus becomes “unrecomendable” for Helmholtz, because it overstrains the ear. Stumpf's research, in contrast, has its point of departure in the historically given set of intervals and tries to find a principle that would explain this choice. His tests with experimental subjects who have no conscious knowledge of musical harmony and prove incapable to follow or reproduce music reveals to him a difference between the unity and multiplicity of tones.},

  abstract = {There was a drastic shift in the aesthetics of music from the twentieth century, and this placed new performance demands on musicians. These technical and expressive demands often include extended techniques, which are methods for producing novel timbres. This study undertakes an examination of these extended techniques on the viola. It is necessary for the modern violist to be familiar with extended techniques, but they are not part of standard training on the instrument, as the majority of the standard etudes come from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and do not address modern technical challenges. Because contemporary pedagogical literature is scarce for the viola and few etudes address extended techniques, six etudes have been commissioned as a practical application for this project. These etudes help to introduce and refine facility with extended techniques for students at an intermediate level.   Extended techniques are often learned when a student is advanced, but they can and should be taught to younger students. The techniques are sometimes thought of as being unusual or challenging, but they are based on fundamental techniques and can contribute to and improve overall technical and musical abilities. This project begins with an introduction and a literature review, followed by the third chapter which provides a context for extended techniques with a brief history of the instrument and its pedagogy. The fourth chapter explores various extended techniques, the fifth chapter discusses the commissioned etudes, and the conclusion reiterates the importance of learning extended techniques.},

Hence, we discuss the instantiation of a design and visualization pipeline for music notation that follows a structured approach, based on the fundamental concepts of information and data visualization. This enables practitioners and researchers of digital humanities and information visualization, alike, to conceptualize, create, and analyze novel music notation methods. Based on the analysis of relevant stakeholders and their usage of music notation as a mean of communication, we identify a set of relevant features typically encoded in different annotations and encodings, as used by interpreters, performers, and readers of music. We analyze the visual mappings of musical dimensions for varying notation methods to highlight gaps and frequent usages of encodings, visual channels, and Gestalt laws. This detailed analysis leads us to the conclusion that such an under-researched area in information visualization holds the potential for fundamental research. This paper discusses possible research opportunities, open challenges, and arguments that can be pursued in the process of analyzing, improving, or rethinking existing music notation systems and techniques.},

The project considers the unprecedented expansion of flute techniques since the Sequenza and the profound impact this has had on performance practice in new music composed for the flute. It addresses a number of critical issues faced by flautists in the absence of a standardised pedagogy and inconsistency of notation, and explores the role of the performer as a contributor in the performance of new music. The submission takes the form of four compact disc recordings of repertoire chosen from a wide timeframe, beginning with Claude Debussy’s Prélude à l'après-midi d’un faune of 1894 and moving through to Daniel Börtz’s Tinted Paintings in 2001. The repertoire was selected in order to highlight and explore problems encountered when performing extended techniques, and to demonstrate the ways in which various extended techniques are used by composers. In so doing the study brings into focus important issues of modern flute performance practice, and suggests possible strategies for addressing various technical and interpretative challenges.},

These are believed to play only a minor role for stabilizing vibrations and no role for perception. Here, torsion is measured on both sides of the bow contact point for a variety of bridge-bow distances on a cello string. Every periodic string release is preceeded by a reverse torsional motion independent from bowing position or dynamics. Transverse and torsional motions are coupled and there are cases of stabilization, but also cases of perturbation or surrender. Structural and timing analyses of torsional waves suggest that the earlier concepts of differential slipping can be essentially confirmed while the concept of Schelleng ripples cannot be confirmed and the concept of subharmonics is under question.},

  abstract = {Abstract                              Natural harmonics, i.e. partials and their harmonic series, may be isolated on a vibrating string by lightly touching specific points along its length. In addition to the two endpoints, stationary                nodes                for a given partial                n                present themselves at                n                − 1 locations along the string, dividing it into                n                parts of equal length. It is not the case, however, that touching any one of these nodes will necessarily isolate the                n                th partial and its integer multiples. The subset of nodes that will activate the                n                th partial (termed                playable nodes                by the authors) may be derived by following a mathematically predictable pattern described by so-called                Farey sequences                . The authors derive properties of these sequences and connect them to physical phenomena. This article describes various musical applications: locating single natural harmonics, forming melodies of neighbouring harmonics, sounding multiphonic aggregates, as well as predicting the relative tuneability of just intervals.},

I continue others’ efforts to provincialize language and correct the damage done by “symbolocentrism’s” continued reliance on post-Saussurian models of signification and structure by addressing processes of purpose, effect, and agency in meaning. Emphases on language and/or structure mislead explanations of musical meaning and compromise the understanding of meaning itself. By foregrounding the unique properties of indexicality in musical practice, and highlighting three distinct indexical processes that drive music’s meaning (deictic, metonym, and replica), I help free meaning from language and offer an ethnomusicological counterpoint to multidisciplinary efforts that define meaning within linguistic and physiological paradigms. Indexical meaning is direct but unpredictable, rooted in experience, embodied habits, and the here and now.},

  abstract = {[The highly publicized and promising career of the piano virtuoso Paul Wittgensein (1887–1961), older brother of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, was dramatically cut short by events of WWI. On reconnaissance patrol during the Austrian army's first advance into Poland, he was severely wounded and suffered the amputation of his right arm. Remarkably, Wittgenstein continued his performing career by commissioning the leading composers of his time to address his special abilities on the concerto and chamber music stage. Richard Strauss furnished the pianist with two largescale works for piano left-hand and orchestra, the Parergon zur Symphonia domestica and the Panathenäenzug. Immediately upon receipt, composer and performer embarked on a dialectic process of modifications that reshaped the musical, structural and interpretive aspects of both works. This compelling synthesis of musical inspiration and virtuosity not only brings into focus the relationship between performance and the musical text but also permits us to discover how the Strauss/Wittgenstein collaborations, particularly with regard to the Parergon, was initially performed and heard. La carrière très médiatisée et prometteuse du pianiste virtuose Paul Wittgenstein (1887–1961), frère aîné du philosophe Ludwig Wittgenstein, a été dramatiquement écourtée par les événements de la Première Guerre mondiale. En patrouille de reconnaissance pendant la première avance de l'armée autrichienne en Pologne, il a été grièvement blessé et a subi l'amputation de son bras droit. Remarquablement, Wittgenstein a continué sa carrière d'interprète en commandant aux grands compositeurs de son temps des concertos et des œuvres de musique de chambre faisant appel à ses capacités spéciales. Richard Strauss a fourni au pianiste deux grandes œuvres d'envergure pour piano main gauche et orchestre, Parergon zur Symphonia domestica et Panathenäenzug. Dès réception, compositeur et interprète se sont engagés dans un processus dialectique de modifications qui a réorganisé les aspects musicaux, structuraux et interprétatifs des deux œuvres. Cette synthèse convaincante d'inspiration musicale et de virtuosité met non seulement en lumière la relation entre l'interprétation et le texte musical, mais nous permet aussi de découvrir comment les collaborations entre Strauss et Wittgenstein, en particulier en ce qui concerne Parergon, ont d'abord été interprétées et entendues. Die vielversprechende Karriere des Klaviervirtuosen Paul Wittgenstein (1887–1961), älterer Bruder des Philosophen Ludwig Wittgenstein, wurde in dramatischer Weise von den Ereignissen des Ersten Weltkrieges unterbrochen. Während des Einmarsches der Österreichischen Armee in Polen, wurde Paul schwer verwundet und musste sich der Amputation seines rechten Armes unterziehen. Bemerkenswerterweise konnte er seine pianistische Karriere fortsetzen indem er die führenden Komponisten seiner Zeit beauftragte seine speziellen Bedürfnisse auf der Konzertund Kammermusikbühne zu unterstützen. Richard Strauss komponierte dem Pianisten zwei große Werke für Klavier linke Hand mit Orchesterbegleitung, das Parergon zur Symphonia domestica Op. 73, und den Panathenäenzug Op. 74. Unmittelbar nach Fertigstellung der Werke begannen Komponist und Interpret an einem Überarbeitungsvorgang der die musikalischen, strukturellen und interpretativen Aspekte beider Werke grundlegend veränderte. Diese verpflichtende Synthese von musikalischer Inspiration und Virtuosität stellt nicht nur die Beziehung zwischen Aufführung und Notentext in den Mittelpunkt, sondern erlaubt Einblicke wie sich die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Strauss und Wittgenstein—insbesondere im Hinblick auf das Parergon—auf die Interpretation auswirkte.]},

  abstract = {This article argues for a processual and experiential approach to dealing with music. Starting from the theoretical writings of James, Dewey and von Uexküll as well as from empirical evidence from current neurobiological research, it introduces an adaptive model of sense-making, relying heavily on the epistemological paradigms of ¿embodied¿ and ¿experiential cognition¿. Central in this approach is an ¿enactive¿ conception of music cognition as the outcome of interactions with the sounds, stressing the role of the cogniser as an actor who constructs and organises his/her knowledge. This involves low-level reactive machinery¿a kind of lock-and-key¿as well as higher-order cognitive mediation that goes beyond mere causality and that allows the music user to ¿cope¿ with the sounds. Is music something out there? A kind of artefact that is reified or objectified, and that can be dealt with in a static way? Or does it rely on processes which call forth interactions with the sounds? Should we conceive of music users besides the music, and think about music as something which is perceived, conceptualised and enacted upon in order to be meaningful? And if so, what is the role of the body and the mind in this process of sense-making? This paper tries to answer these questions by introducing a theoretical framework that leans heavily on the seminal writings of John Dewey, William James and Jakob von Uexküll, together with empirical evidence from current neurobiological research. Its central focus, however, is on the role of musical experience and the way we make sense of it (see Blacking, 1955, Määttänen, 1993, Reybrouck, 2004b, Westerlund, 2002). The musical experience is multifaceted: it is crucial in the construction of musical knowledge and points in the direction of a processual approach to dealing with music¿with ¿embodied¿ and ¿experiential cognition¿ as major epistemological paradigms. But what exactly is embodied and experiential cognition? And how are both related to the process of dealing with music? In order to answer these questions, I propose to introduce a general adaptive model of sense-making which is grounded in our biology and our cognitive abilities (Reybrouck, 2005a, 2006b) in an attempt to bring together body, mind and music. There are, in fact, current conceptual developments in cognitive science which argue for the inclusion of the body in our understanding of the mind. As such, it is possible to articulate a plausible and grounded theory which is closely related to theories of cognitive organisation which treat cognition as an activity that is structured by the body which is immersed in an environment that shapes its experience. Or put in other terms: cognition depends upon experiences based in having a body¿with sensorimotor capacities¿that are embedded in an encompassing biological, psychological, and cultural context (Lakoff \& Johnson, 1999, and for a musical analogy: Iyer, 2002 and Saslaw, 1996). This approach to cognition¿the embodiment hypothesis¿suggests an alternative basis for cognitive processes in general. It understands perception as perceptually guided action (see below), and conceives of sensory and motor processes as being fundamentally inseparable, mutually informative, and structured so as to ground our conceptual systems (Varela, Thompson \& Rosch, 1991: 173). It allows the cognisers to explore their environment with their bodies and their senses, correlating multisensory input with bodily experience through elaborate mechanisms of feedback among the sensory and motor apparatus, and with temporary information in the sensory input being matched to motor images of the body in the sensorimotor loop (Todd, 1999). In this embodied viewpoint, the mind is no longer seen as passively reflective of the outside world, but as an active constructor of its own reality. In particular, cognition and bodily activity intertwine to a high degree in the sense that the fundamental building blocks of cognitive processes are control schemata for motor patterns which arise from perceptual interactions with the environment. This means that the drives for the cognitive system arise from within the system itself, in the form of needs and goals, and not merely from the outer world (Prem, 1996).},

We undertake a comparative study of saxophone multiphonics from the musical, perceptual, and acoustical points of view. We propose four major classes based on the analysis of the musical attributes and playing techniques of a set of 118 alto saxophone multiphonics, spanning all the possible sonorities previously reported. Then, we perform a dissimilarity rating experiment for all possible pairs of a subset of 15 representative multiphonics. This experiment provides confidence in the suggested classification, since the four classes are segregated in a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) representation. We also find two possible acoustical correlates of the perceptual dimensions: the spectral centroid (SC) and the modulation frequency (MF). Finally, this last representation is explored through morphing trajectories, which correspond to multiphonics that change the timbre and musical interval organization with fixed fingering.

  abstract = {Purpose– A need to renew music-related information notions arises from both information-seeking models and literature of musical semiotics. The purpose of this paper is to create a music information typology, which aims at facilitating the examination of music information types at varying levels of abstraction in the context of information seeking. Design/methodology/approach– Literature of musical semiotics and information seeking are juxtaposed to develop a novel approach to music-related information. The grounding concepts are Bruner’s enactive, iconic and symbolic modes of representation. The modes of representation offer a universal scheme of knowledge that is applied to the domain of music by defining their content through Tarasti’s Theory of Musical Semiotics. Findings– This conceptual paper results in a music information typology ranging from the enactive music information representations to the abstract ones as follows. Music making as the first mode of enactive representations; music listening as the second mode of enactive representations; iconic representations of music; technological models of music as the first mode of symbolic representations; and ideological models of music as the second mode of symbolic representations. Originality/value– The present paper develops a music information typology that encompasses broadly different music information facets by categorizing music information sources according to their level of abstraction. When applied into empirical research, the typology opens a new window into the perceived roles of music information types in the context of information seeking.},

C’est à partir d’elles que l’on trouve une pluralité de textes et de systèmes mixtes et dérivés. Cette théorie est fondée sur la phénoménologie et la sémiotique de C.S. Peirce. La base de ces trois matrices est constituée par les trois classes de signes principaux de la typologie peircienne : le qualisigne iconique rhématique, le sinsigne indexical dicentique et le légisigne symbolique argumentatif. La théorie postule que les processus sémiotiques sonores sont à discuter principalement à la lumière de la première de ces triades. Les signes visuels appartiennent à la deuxième et les signes verbaux à la troisième triade. Ces classes sont des constructions abstraites, qui nous aident à comprendre les combinaisons réelles des signes existants. Ce principe vaut aussi pour les deux autres matrices. La prépondérance de la première triade pour la musique ne signifie pas que la musique ne présente pas, quant à elle, de signes mixtes. Au contraire. Cependant, cela n’implique pas l’absence d’un centre de rayonnement, dont la fonction est de définir, par la domination d’une classe de signes sur les autres, la constitution du caractère sémiotique de la musique comme système de signes spécifiques. Ce travail cherche à discuter ces aspects de la musique.},

  abstract = {The ubiquity and diversity of notational practices in music suggest that notation is a significant part of human beings' musicking behaviour. However, it is difficult to address its function since the usual conception of notation in music scholarship is at odds with studying performance in the first place. This article presents a methodological outline for an ethnomusicology of music notation by investigating the musicality of notation not in terms of its representation of musical structures, but in terms of its mediation of the social and creative agency of musicians. It is suggested that, rather than detracting from musical reality, notation composes musical cultures. This constructive work is simultaneously ontological and ethical. It is described in terms of three distinct processes, namely mobilization, entextualization and remediation. In doing so, this article presents an interdisciplinary approach to a topic that has traditionally defined the disciplinary centre of music scholarship.},

  abstract = {Cet article propose une discussion sur le rôle du timbre (la couleur du son) à l’intérieur du cadre théorique de la sémiotique française, ainsi que celui de la sémiotique de la chanson, et spécialement dans le cadre théorique développé par Tatit (1997) et plus récémmement par Carmo Jr. (2005, 2007). Il est commun de considérer le timbre comme un inventaire non-fini. Cette question demeure problématique car le point du vue sémiotique adopté dans ce travail considère la hauteur et le rythme en tant qu’éléments distinctifs d’une mélodie, tandis que d’autres paramètres se comportent comme des éléments non distinctifs (la dynamique, le tempo et le timbre). En se basant sur l’opposition « schéma vs. usage » proposée par Hjelmslev, cet article soutient que le timbre se comporte comme une variable liée à l’usage. Le matériau analysé a été extrait de descriptions verbales du timbre présentées dans des manuels d’orchestration et d’instrumentation. Ces données seront interprétées en termes d’implication et de concession dans l’approche tensive de la sémiotique (Fontanille \& Zilberberg, 1998 ; Zilberberg, 2011). Notre hypothèse peut être corroborée par d’autres témoignages de phénomènes similaires observés tant dans le système grammatical des langues naturelles que dans leur pratique discursive. Il est attendu que les arguments soulevés dans cet article puissent contribuer à une discussion sur l’approche sémiotique du timbre, qui demeure considérablement inexploré.},

  abstract = {This book addresses one of the most exciting and innovative developments within higher education: the rise in prominence of the creative arts and the accelerating recognition that creative practice is a form of research. The book considers how creative practice can lead to research insights through what is often known as practice-led research. But unlike other books on practice-led research, it balances this with discussion of how research can impact positively on creative practice through research-led practice. The editors posit an iterative and web-like relationship between practice and research. Essays within the book cover a wide range of disciplines including creative writing, dance, music, theatre, film and new media, and the contributors are from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The subject is approached from numerous angles: the authors discuss methodologies of practice-led research and research-led practice, their own creative work as a form of research, research training for creative practitioners, and the politics and histories of practice-led research and research-led practice within the university. The book will be invaluable for creative practitioners, researchers, students in the creative arts and university leaders. Key Features The first book to document, conceptualise and analyse practice-led research in the creative arts and to balance it with research-led practice Written by highly qualified academics and practitioners across the creative arts and sciences Brings together empirical, cultural and creative approaches Presents illuminating case histories of creative work and practice-led research},

This corpus of text will benefit pianists and composers alike, and it provides the answers to the questions "what is a piano multiphonic", "what does a multiphonic sound like," and "how to notate a multiphonic sound". New terminology will be defined and inaccuracies in existing terminology will be dealt with. The multiphonic "mode of playing" will be separated from "playing technique" and from flageolets. Moreover, multiphonics in the repertoire are compared from the aspects of composition and notation, and the portability of multiphonics to the sounds of other instruments or to other mobile playing modes of the manipulated grand piano are examined. Composers tend to use multiphonics in a different manner, making for differing notational choices. This study examines notational choices and proposes a notation suitable for most situations, and notates the most commonly produceable multiphonic chords. The existence of piano multiphonics will be verified mathematically, supported by acoustic recordings and camera measurements. In my work, the correspondence of FFT analysis and hearing will be touched on, and by virtue of audio excerpts I offer ways to improve as a listener of multiphonics. It is observed that to produce of multiphonics the musician needs to have specialized knowledge, a small amount of technique and detailed instructions from the composer. Multiphonics are not impossible to produce, contrary to what a lack of prior literature would suggest},

  abstract = {Spectral Immersions: A Comprehensive Guide To The Theory And Practice Of Bass Clarinet Multiphonics is a multi-component thesis that looks into the entire area of multiphonic analysis and composition for the bass clarinet. A literary section of the thesis looks at past publications and the problems associated with using this contemporary technique, in terms of both compositional and performance issues. A theoretical analysis of Type One multiphonics gives an insight into how multiphonics on the bass clarinet work in a more scientific way and their close relationship with the harmonic series. A complete analysis of Type Two multiphonics using past charts and new-found fingerings results in the creation of the new SW multiphonic charts for the bass clarinet. The new SW charts are fully tested by correcting problems in past compositions by means of several student compositional projects at various UK universities. Finally, a new set of études and pieces have been commissioned by composers from the UK and abroad. The results and successes of the pieces and new SW charts are analysed and can be listened to via accompanying audio and data CDs. The results of this thesis provide both performers and composers with an accurate, exhaustive and up-to-date usable publication. Not only does this thesis provide a new set of multiphonic charts, but the addition of compositional examples using multiphonics provides both practice and recital material for performers and useful compositional technique hints and advice for composers wishing to use this resource in the future.},

  abstract = {This series of Reaction Time experiments investigates how quickly notes can be read from a screen and immediately executed on a MIDI keyboard. This makes it possible to study pitch reading and motor coordination in considerable detail away from the customary confounds of rhythm reading or pulse entrainment. The first experiment found that reaction times were slower in extreme keys (3\#, 4\#, 3b, 4b), even for very experienced sightreaders, a large effect of clef in most individuals, and other results suggesting that, in this simple paradigm at least, reading notation presents more of a difficulty to execution than motor coordination. A second experiment found, in addition, an effect of order in which the notes were presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract              This article forms part of ‘The Microtonal Piano – and the tuned-in interpreter’, an ongoing artistic research project at the Norwegian Academy of Music that seeks to demonstrate how microtonality can increase the expressive possibilities of the acoustic piano. Many different modes of playing can result in microtonal sounds, and this article presents a preliminary overview of these possibilities. For the project, new works have been commissioned from several composers, and different aspects of microtonal modes of playing are integrated into these works. Multiphonics is obviously one of these modes of playing, as it most often results in microtonality. At the end of the article, different ways that multiphonics can be modified when used in combination with some of the other microtonal modes of playing are suggested.},
